                        <p>
                            Howdy!! My name is Spencer Callaway. I am a native Texan and Austinite. I live
                            in the northern area of Austin close to Cedar Park and Leander. I am a Texas A&ampM graduate 
                             with a degree in plant and environmental soil science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After college I couldn't find a job in my degree field without having to go back to 
                            college for an extended period of time. So I worked a few odd jobs starting with a emergency home 
                            restoration company, after that I worked for Life Storage as an assistant manager,
                            and now I currently work part time at Twin Liquors while I'm completing a Coding BootCamp to become a full-stack web developer.
                    </p>
                          
                            <p> I am a musician and a gamer. I have several instruments and I have been a musician for close to 17 years.
                                     I game mostly on my PC but I also have a few console systems. 
                            </p>
